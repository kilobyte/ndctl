Package: ndctl
Section: misc
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, cxl
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Utility for managing the nvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the nvdimm (non-volatile memory
 device) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libndctl6

Description: Utility library for managing the libnvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility library for managing the libnvdimm
 (non-volatile memory device) sub-system in the Linux kernel.

Package: libndctl-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libndctl6 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libndctl
 Header files and development library for compiling C programs to link
 with the libndctl library and manage the libnvdimm sub-system in the
 Linux kernel.

Description: Utility for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the device DAX subsystem in the
 Linux kernel.

Package: libdaxctl1
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utility library for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
 .
 This package contains a utility library used by applications to manage the
 device DAX subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libdaxctl-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libdaxctl1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libdaxctl

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: utility library for managing Compute Express Link devices
 CXL (Compute Express Link) is a family of PCIe-based protocols that can be
 used to connect high-speed I/O and memory devices.  This library includes
 code to enumerate/query/configure such devices.

Description: provisioning for CXL device memory
 This utility provides commands for enumerating and provisioning CXL devices.
 CXL is a protocol that allows accessing memory over the PCI bus (PCIe â‰¥ 5)
 with full cache coherency.  The access can be in either direction, with
 latencies closer to that of DDR (usually less than twice as bad) rather than
 those usually associated with PCI attached storage.
 .
 This can be used eg. for installing many terabytes of memory into one
 machine, dynamically sharing a pool of memory between machines in a rack,
 letting a smart NIC use the host's memory on its own, letting a GPU access
 both the host's memory and its own concurrently with the host, etc.
