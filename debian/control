# RPM-world's name for cxl tools
Provides: cxl-cli
Description: Utility for managing the nvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the nvdimm (non-volatile memory
 device) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Description: Utility library for managing the libnvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility library for managing the libnvdimm
 (non-volatile memory device) sub-system in the Linux kernel.

Package: libndctl-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libndctl6 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libndctl
 Header files and development library for compiling C programs to link
 with the libndctl library and manage the libnvdimm sub-system in the
 Linux kernel.

Description: Utility for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the device DAX subsystem in the
 Linux kernel.

Package: libdaxctl1

Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utility library for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
 .
 This package contains a utility library used by applications to manage the
 device DAX subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libdaxctl-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libdaxctl1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libdaxctl

 Linux kernel.

Package: libcxl1
Architecture: linux-any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: utility library for managing Compute Express Link devices
 CXL (Compute Express Link) is a family of PCIe-based protocols that can be
 used to connect high-speed I/O and memory devices.  This library includes
 code to enumerate/query/configure such devices.
